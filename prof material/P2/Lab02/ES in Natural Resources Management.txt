Abstract
--------------
The modern era of science and technology has brought the whole civilization in the computer culture where our most of the activities are influenced directly or indirectly by a computer. This era is the era of expert skill. Everywhere in every domain relevant expertise is the most wanted thing. The major problems in accessing a human expert in a particular field are unavailability and scarcity of real experts and if the human expert is available then there may be problem for common people in making contact with him. Consultation may be very expensive and human expert may feel the repetitive job uninteresting. This in turn may affect expert’s efficiency. The other major problems that are being faced by the human expert are the limitation of his memory and processing inability of all the essential knowledge required in the process of decision-making. As a result of researches and developments, day by day, new knowledge in enormous amount is being added in every discipline and thus more relevant and accurate advice can be taken from a human expert if his own knowledge is updated which is not an easy task. Human experts are bounded by limitations and it is quite impossible for a human expert to consider all the essential factors while taking decision. Something is always escaped and remained unconsidered. Thus some tool or assistance is needed even for an expert to update his knowledge and get help in decision making process. Today everybody is expecting the best quality solution of his problems in different areas, which is naturally possible only when the Solver (human or machine) is an expert of that area. The available human experts are beyond the reach of everybody. Sometimes there exists a valuable expert on a particular subject and it may be desirable to have a substitute expert in the case of his unavailability. A substitute human expert might be prohibitively expensive or the original expert might be unique in his or her knowledge and experience, or perhaps a substitute human expert can’t be found. Under such circumstances the absentee of expert may cause huge harm to the related organization. In the researches and developments in science and technology, attempts have been always made to overcome the problems of people. The advancements made in the discipline of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science and Eng. have tackled the problems related to mental and intellectual processes of the people. Gradual advancements in these disciplines have enhanced our cognitive capabilities. From very beginning scientists and researchers of AI have been trying to produce systems that can behave like an intelligent being. In course of such developments scientists, researchers and other related resource persons realized the clue of human expertise in a particular field and tried to encode and assimilate the knowledge and experience of human experts in computer that led to the notion of development of expert systems in different domains. An expert system is a computer-based program that uses knowledge, facts and different reasoning techniques to solve problems that normally require the abilities of experts. The program asks series of questions about the concerned problem and gives appropriate advice based on its store of knowledge. The knowledge, the expert system uses is made up of either rules or experience information about the behavior of elements of a particular subject domain. Such systems can be designed for specific hardware and software configurations, or they can be software systems that are designed to run on a general-purpose computer. Expert systems of today support many problem solving activities such as decision making, knowledge fusing, designing, and planning, forecasting, regulating, controlling, monitoring, identifying, diagnosing, prescribing, interpreting, explaining, training etc. using different techniques and it is expected that future expert systems will support even more activities. In the beginning, expert systems were developed in the chemical and scientific domains and by the end of 1970s expert systems were operating in the medicine, chemical, education, natural resources and science domains. Expert system started to gain popularity in the early 1980s. The announcement of successful operational systems like PROSPECTOR [1,2] a natural resources system that evaluates geographic sites for potential mineral deposits of commercial interest, MYCIN , medical consulting system, etc. catalysed the expert system technology. The availability of powerful tools to develop expert system have made possible creation of large number of expert systems in different domains. With the increasing interest in expert systems and availability of more powerful tools many more expert systems are being developed for new domains. The knowledge engineers are trying to use better knowledge representation and control strategies to develop more powerful expert systems. Today the most important applications of expert systems are those in which expert systems access databases used for other purpose or linked to other types of software and systems. Many valuable applications in future will combine conventional data processing with expert system technology. The linkage of expert systems with database management systems, management information systems, decision support systems, process control, office automation, geographical information system will tend to take place due to combination of knowledge engineering and information engineering [3]. 

In this article the main purpose is to present essentials of design and development technology of expert system through expert system for photo interpretation (see proceedings of MAP India 2002 &2003) and their application in the natural resource database management to facilitate the remote sensing applications.
